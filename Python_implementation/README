REQUIREMENTS:
 This code is written in Python 3.11 and is mainly based on Numpy >= 1.23.5 and Scipy 1.12
 running on a Linux or Windows distribution. The required packages are:
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib
    - tqdm
    
 These can be installed by running:
    # sudo pip install numpy matplotlib tqdm scipy

USAGE:
 The code can be used to generate the simulations used in the paper "Leakage
 Certification Made Simple" published in Crypto 2024. The parameters can be changed in main.py and have the
 following usage:




 Once the desired parameters are set, one can start the script with:
    python3 main_sim.py
