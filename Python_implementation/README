We have updated the python code of the Gao's paper implementation that has been provided in:
"https://github.com/wgao9/mixed_KSG/blob/master/mixed.py"

The link of the Gao's MI estimator paper: https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/hash/ef72d53990bc4805684c9b61fa64a102-Abstract.html

REQUIREMENTS:
 This code is written in Python 3.11 and is mainly based on Numpy >= 1.23.5 and Scipy 1.12
 running on a Linux or Windows distribution. The required packages are:
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib
    - tqdm
    
 These can be installed by running:
    # sudo pip install numpy matplotlib tqdm scipy

USAGE:
 The code can be used to generate the simulations used in the paper "Leakage
 Certification Made Simple" published in Crypto 2024. The parameters can be changed in main_sim.py and have the
 following usage:
 sig : the standard deviation of the noise
 n_trial : Number of repitation need to consider for convergence plot
 n_samples: Provide the range of number of traces on which the convergence plot is going to be calculated

 Once the desired parameters are set, one can start the script with:
    python3 main_sim.py
 We also implement the Leakage certification of "AES_HD_ext" dataset by using main.py
